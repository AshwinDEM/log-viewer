# Log Viewer
In windows, if you create a new text file and write .LOG in the first line of the file, it becomes a log file.
This project aims to create a way to easily view and understand log files.

Basic structure of a windows log file


```
.LOG
HH:MM DD-MM-YYYY
<Log Entry>
HH:MM DD-MM-YYYY
<Log Entry>
```

The aim is to create a project that can view log files in a manner that is easy for people, and maybe also manipulate the log entries.
